# Introduction
Hello! My name is Jaelyn Bates and I am a recently graduated high school senior. In the fall of 2020, I will be attending UCLA. My career goals are to leverage the power of Quantum Computing and Artificial Intelligence to make a positive impact on the world. I want to use these advanced technologies to make an impact in health &amp; medicine, economics, and education. I want to help other underrepresented groups become interested in STEM as well.  I have been learning how to code in multiple languages for about 2 years now. I have created many projects but have never gained the courage to share them publiclyâ€¦.until now!! I will be uploading my projects here on Github and will hopefully help others with their projects. I have started learning about open source and how to contribute to open source. I am excited to put the information I learned into practice.   If you have any tips for me or my projects, please reach out! I am always open to help and criticism. You can message me on Twitter @bates_Jaelyn.
